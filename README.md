Rationale behind f2f & tools:
The tool we used for f-2-f-like collaboration was Microsoft teams. the rationale behind it was it is a service supplied to us by the school and has easy screen sharing and other such features to support mobbing. Teams also offers a great recording tool for our mobbing sessions. Our team decided on IntelliJ IDEA as it is a powerful IDE that is offered to students for free, so it was easy for all of us to get the same IDE and work together. We decided on SonarLint because it was currently supported by our IDE after trying Clover from Atlassian because cover was not compatible with the latest version of the IDE.

Step 3: Code Coverage Tool

As stated above our team used SonarLint as our code coverage tool because it was compatible with the IDE we decided to use IntelliJ IDEA.
